## Installation and Usage

When I open my application and I run `npm run start` in the root directory, my application should start from the backend and serve the client. When my application is running, my JavaScript files should be bundled using webpack. When my webpack plugins are run, I should find that I have generated a HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file. When JavaScript next-gen is used, then I want my text editor to still funciton in the browser withou any errors adnw hen it is opened, then I want my IndexedDB ahs creare a database storage. When I enter contents and click of the DOM window, I want my contents to be saved in the IndexDB. When I reopen the text editor, then I will find that my conetnst have been retrieved from the IndexedDB.When I click on the install button, then the web applciation will be downloaded as an icon into my computer. When my applicaiton is loaded, then I should have a registered serevice worker using workbox.When I laod my service worker,I shpuld have static assets pre cached when laoded along with pages and static asseets and when I deploy to Heroku, I should have the build scripts needed for my webpack application.
